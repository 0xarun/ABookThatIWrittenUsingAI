# A Book That I Written Using AI

so yeah, i wrote a book using ai.  
not sure if itâ€™s deep or just random stuff i had in my head.  
felt like doing it, so i did. took around an hour or something.  

## what's inside?

**The Unbound Self â€“ Living Beyond the Human Framework**

just me talking about life, people, the system, and living as one person without all the noise.  
not trying to teach or inspire anyone. just thoughts.

## why?

idk. just felt like making a book using ai.  
thought itâ€™d be cool. now itâ€™s here.

## read it or donâ€™t

if you want, you can read the full pdf [here](./the-unbound-self-living-beyond-the-human-framework-STANDARD.pdf).  
might sound smart. might sound dumb. thatâ€™s on you ðŸ˜„
